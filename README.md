# evgl-mash-web

Maud + Axum + SeaORM + Supabase/PostgreSQL + HTMX + WebSocket web server for Evento Globolo.

**Product:** Evento Globolo — A global event discovery and aggregation platform.

Aggregate, normalize, deduplicate, search, and follow events from sources such as Eventbrite, Meetup, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Craigslist through authorized APIs or permitted ingestion paths.

## Safety and production boundary

Provider names are integration targets, not claims of affiliation. Use official APIs and permitted data-access methods; do not bypass authentication, anti-bot, rate-limit, copyright, or platform-policy controls.

This repository is an executable bootstrap, not a production deployment. Before live
use, add authentication, tenant authorization, rate limits, durable migrations,
observability, backups, incident response, dependency review, and secret management.
## Stack

Maud renders escaped server-side HTML, Axum serves HTTP/WebSockets, HTMX handles
progressive updates, SeaORM connects to Supabase-compatible PostgreSQL, and the
browser refreshes fragments after WebSocket notifications.

`DATABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_URL` are optional for the in-memory bootstrap. Never
expose a Supabase service-role key to browser code.
